## Background

*   Can use Jupyter notebooks whcih is an Integrated Development        Environment, which have extension .ipynb
* Can embed a jupyter cell into quarto by writing ```{python} and  the 3 back ticks again after

```{python}
3+4
```

* Jupyter has 2 parts, the kernel (the bit that runs the code) and a dashboard (basically a user interface)
* In Jupyter, code is written in cells
* We can add explanatory text in notebooks using markdown, and in Jupyter notebooks we can toggle between code and markdown in the drop-down menu 
* When writing in markdown, use the # for headers of various sizes, bold is two ** s on either side (**like this** ) and italics is just the one * (*like this*)
