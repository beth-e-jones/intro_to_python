## File paths
* Absolute file locations include stuff like our username for internal work
* Relative path is the location relative to the working directory which 
begins with .. so it can work for everyone whos working directory is set to 
same notebooks folder
* Two full stops .. - the code we use can go back up a level in the folder
structure because we can't move directly between subfolders in directory
* Recommend forward slashes in file paths - windows explorer often has back 
slashes which can cause issues further down line

## Flat files
